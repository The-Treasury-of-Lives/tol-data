The current structure is thirteen stories tall, making it one of the world&#39;s tallest buildings to have pre-existed the modern skyscraper. &nbsp;It is considered a masterpiece that represents the pinnacle of classical Tibetan architectural style and highlights the ingenuity of the Palace&#39;s artisans and builders who were constrained by limited resources. It was designated a UNESCO world heritage site in 1994.</p>
<p>
	The existing palace is largely attributed to the <a href=""/biographies/view/Fifth-Dalai-Lama/TBRC_P37"">Fifth Dalai Lama</a>, who undertook an immense expansion of the original structure, which is dated to the year 637 during the reign of <a href=""/biographies/view/Songtsen-Gampo/TBRC_P8067"">Songtsen Gampo</a>.

The Fifth Dalai Lama began building the White Palace upon the original foundation in 1645, with construction continuing until 1653. Thousands of workers and artisans hailing from near and far took part in the project. &nbsp;It would become the seat of the Ganden Podrang government (previously located at <a href=""/geographies/view/Drepung/TBRC_G108"">Drepung</a>), and the winter home of the Dalai Lamas (in summer, they resided at <a href=""/geographies/view/Norbulingka-Palace/TBRC_G4145"">Norbulingka Palace</a>). &nbsp;When the Fifth Dalai Lama passed away in 1682, his Regent, <a href=""/biographies/view/Desi-Sanggye-Gyatso/TBRC_P421"">Desi Sanggye Gyatso</a>, continued the expansion and completed the building of the Red Palace in 1694, all the while managing to cover-up the Dalai Lama&#39;s death.

Construction on the first building of the complex, Uyab Podrang, was completed around 1755.

Norbulingkha contains palace buildings, government buildings, and the opera grounds where outdoor performances are held.</p>

	In March of 1959, Norbulingka was an important site of resistance to Chinese occupation. Crowds of Tibetans surrounded the palace in an effort to guard the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who was inside the complex, having declined an invitation to attend a performance at the Chinese military camp.
